\begin{abstract}
The project aims to leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
enhance code exploration of Android applications by enabling intelligent
interaction with their Graphical User Interface (GUI). Traditional
static analysis and manual code reviews can be inefficient and
time-consuming, particularly in large, complex applications. This
approach integrates MLLMs with computer vision and natural language
processing to analyze the app's GUI dynamically, extracting UI
components, inferring their functionality, and linking them to
corresponding code segments. By interacting with the app in real-time --
simulating user actions such as button presses and text inputs -- the
model can generate structured insights about code behavior, identify
security vulnerabilities, and assist developers in debugging.
