At the moment the program supports only native android applications. It
is necessary to expand the tool to support applications with different
technologies like: - webview applications - React Native - Flutter -
dotnet

\subsection{Fine-Tune open source
model}\label{fine-tune-open-source-model}

Open Source models have achieved a low performance compared to a
proprietary model. It would be interesting to see if a fine-tuned model
for this task could reach at the least the performance level of
