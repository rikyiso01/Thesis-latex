Application scanners are one of the tools used in black box testing as
they explore the application detecting vulnerabilities and bugs in an
automated way. One problem in application scanners is their inhability
to discover deeper states, leaving potential bugs undetected. One of the
main shortcomings of application scanner.

Similar work has already been done for web applications exploration
{[}YuraScanner{]}. In this work we focus on applying the same technique
on mobile applications

Dynamic security android application scanners are a useful tool for
detecting malicious behaviour in applications which the source code
isn't available. Unfortunately common dynamic security scanners aren't
capable to explore deeper states, leaving potential malicious behaviours
undetected. This is due to inhability of The recent progresses of large
language models and automated agents
